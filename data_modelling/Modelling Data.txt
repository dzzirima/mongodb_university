patterns
1.Attibute patterns
when we have objects with similar but diference representation
when we have a lot of similar fields
some fields may may be present in one object and not present in another
specs:[{
	k:name ,v:"surname",u:"lastmae"
	}
	]

then create  an index 
kdb.products.createIndex({"specs.k":1,"specs.v":1})

usually used for storing list of dates
or catering for situation where we dont know the fields
working with unpreadictable fields  or rare fileds

2.subset
	used when dealing with large large documnents , just split the document into 
	most used and not frequently used
use case
	reviews
	comments
use a minimum or 20 at most at the rest store them on another document, produce it when 
its requested
