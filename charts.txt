This is incorrect. If you don't see a Chart with three rows, that means you have yet to create 
your text Chart. Please redo it. To get the right value, you want to first narrow items down by 
the type of score. Drag type to the Groups section and make sure to unwind the array. Then, you want the mean 
values of those scores so drag score to the Values section. Unwind the array and choose the mean value.
